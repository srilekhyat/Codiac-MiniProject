C|Introduction|\tWelcome to C Programming, Get ready to start coding!
C|Introduction|\tLet's get started...\n
C|Introduction|\tC is a powerful general-purpose programming language. It can be used to develop software like operating systems, databases, compilers, and so on.
C|Introduction|\tC programming is an excellent language to learn to program for beginners.
C|Introduction|\tDeveloped in 1972, by Dennis M. Ritchie C is the most widely used Computer language.\n
C|Introduction|\tStructure of a C Program:
C|Introduction|\t\tA C Program contains the following:
C|Introduction|\t\t\t> Preprocessor Commands
C|Introduction|\t\t\t> Functions
C|Introduction|\t\t\t> Variables
C|Introduction|\t\t\t> Statements & Expressions
C|Introduction|\t\t\t> Comments\n
C|Introduction|\tNow let's look at a basic C Program - Hello World!
C|Introduction|\t#include <stdio.h>
C|Introduction|\tint main() {
C|Introduction|\t\tprintf("Hello World");
C|Introduction|\t\treturn 0;
C|Introduction|\t}
C|Input|\tWhen we say Input, it means to feed some data into a program. An input can be given in the form of a file or from the command line. 
C|Input|\tC programming provides a set of built-in functions to read the given input and feed it to the program as per requirement.
C|Input|\tscanf is used for taking input from STDIN (Standard Input - Keyboard).
C|Input|\tSyntax:
C|Input|\t--------
C|Input|\t\tint scanf(const char *format, ...)
C|Input|\t\tOn success, the function returns the number of items of the argument list successfully read.
C|Input|\tExample:
C|Input|\t\t#include <stdio.h>
C|Input|\t\tint main() {
C|Input|\t\t\tint x;
C|Input|\t\t\tscanf("%d", &x);
C|Input|\t\t\treturn 0;
C|Input|\t\t}
C|Output|printf is used for displaying on STDOUT
C|Operators|Operators are cool.
C|Conditional Statements|if, if...else, if...else if...else
C|Iterative Statements|For Loops, While Loops, Switch...Case, break...continue...goto
C|Arrays|Arrays are cool.
C|Strings|Strings are cool.
C|Functions|Functions are cool.
C|Recursion|Recursion need Functions.
C|Pointers|Pointers start with a P.
C|Structures & Unions|struct and union.
C|File Handling|Files are cool.
